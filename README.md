An attempt at an interface between Wolfram Mathematica and Canvas LMS API

This is by no means a complete development.
While I've developed this for my own purposes,
I hope the code can be helpful as an example upon which other codes can be built.
The code should be self-explanatory,
look at the comments and at the Canvas API documentation in case something is not clear.
